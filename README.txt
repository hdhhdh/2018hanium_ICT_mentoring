Our team "ADeep" participated in the contest by adding features to the face recognition open source of github.

Open Source Address: https://github.com/yu4u/age-gender-estimation

I modified the demo.py file only and used the same sources for deep learning.
If there is a problem, I will delete it.


The Background and Necessity of Works: With the recent development of ICT Device using Deep Learning, it has become an indispensable technology. 
In a world full of information and trends, we need to identify the needs of our customers rather than the passive advertising system. 
I felt it.

Characteristic: It recognizes a person's face, identifies their age and gender, and provides customized advertisements by age group/sex.

Advantage: It's much more efficient because you can show targeted ads to target people than you can show repeated ads.

Works: 
1. Efficient advertising system 
- Attach the camera to the subway to get on the escalator, billboards, etc. and use deep learning technology to display advertisements suitable for each age group.

2. Propose the first aid method
- If an emergency setup is jaded by someone, stop overrideing and provider AED use and first aid.
